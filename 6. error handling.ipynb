    "If a python code encounter an error, it terminates. There is a way how to handle it - tell Python what to do if some type of error is encountered. For this porpouse, we can use these statements:\n",
    "<li> try: test this code for an error\n",
    "<li> except: if there is an error, handle it\n",
    "<li> else: if thre is no error, run a specific code\n",
    "<li> finally: regardless of the fact there was an error or not, run this code <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell Python what to do if a specific type of error occurs.\n",
    "This errors might be:\n",
    "<li> NameError\n",
    "<li> TypeError\n",
    "<li>AssertionError\n",
